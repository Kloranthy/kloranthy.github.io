          <h3>
            2019 Summer Internship
          </h3>

          <p>
            During the internship I completed a set of python scripts to automate initializing Digital Ocean droplets for hosting sites made with Ruby on Rails.
            To prepare for the internship I learned python and created an account with Digital Ocean so that I could practice working with droplets.
            During this project I gained a lot of valuable experience with SSH and configuring droplets to require SSH for root login.
            Some of the dependencies could simply be installed with the system package manager but others, such as NGINX and NodeJS, had setup processes that were more complicated.
            I had to learn enough about those dependencies in order to understand how to install and configure them and then verify whether they were installed successfully.
            The internship introduced me to many different tools, libraries, and frameworks used for web applications in addition to providing experience with automating complex processes.
